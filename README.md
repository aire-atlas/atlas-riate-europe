# Installer/manager for the _AIRE_ web atlas

* Project homepage: http://aire-atlas.github.io/

AIRE is a web engine that manages the making of geographical atlases.
Originally named after the French _A.I.R.E._, which means _The Interactive Atlas of European Regions_, this software is a project of _UMS 2414 RIATE_ (which stands for _Réseau interdisciplinaire pour l’aménagement et la cohésion des territoires de l’Europe et de ses voisinages_).

Beyond a simple consultation tool, the atlas allows an acces to multiple representation of the same phenomenon thanks to various spatial analysis methods and to little current cartographic representations in accordance with 5 different European levels.
